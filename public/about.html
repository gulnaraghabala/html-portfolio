<h2>Bio:</h2>

Hailing from Azerbaijan, I embarked on a journey of academic excellence early on, securing a spot among the top 3 students nationwide. My passion for computer science led me to graduate with the highest score from Baku Engineering University, an achievement that's commemorated with my name etched on their esteemed wooden table. My pursuit of knowledge didn't stop there; I'm currently finalizing my PhD in Mathematics at NDSU.

My professional trajectory has seen me delve into diverse roles — from Java web development internships at SOCAR and NETAS to leading a dynamic startup team focused on revolutionizing hotel management in Azerbaijan. Alongside, my participation in coding camps and robotics competitions, and my instructional roles in subjects like Informatics and Linear Algebra, speak to my deep-seated passion for technology and education.

Beyond academics and professional endeavors, I've committed myself to community service, taking up leadership roles in charity initiatives for families in need. My strengths, as identified by the Clifton Strength test — input, ideation, strategic thinking, learning, and achievement — resonate deeply with my personality. With an intuitive mind and a knack for seeing the mapped steps of a problem, I revel in learning, ideation, and leveraging AI tools to find smart and efficient solutions. My interests span from spirituality and psychology to trading and the ever-evolving realm of AI.

Resilience defines me. Despite facing numerous challenges and rejections, my spirit remains unbroken. I firmly believe in moving forward with determination and gratitude. Drawing inspiration from luminaries like Rumi and Nasimi, I resonate with the idea that everyone is vast, boundless, and full of potential. As Rumi says, "Come, come whoever, whatever just come" and as Nasimi beautifully encapsulates, "Two worlds can fit in me, but I cannot fit in them."
